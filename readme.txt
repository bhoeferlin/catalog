WordPress Product Catalog plugin is a convenient tool for organizing the products represented on your website. Each product is assigned to a relevant category, which makes it easier for the customers to search and identify the needed products. It is possible to add an unlimited number of parameters for each of the categories in order to allow a detailed representation of the product. Moreover, each product can be accompanied with an image. Customers are provided with the possibility of rating the products available on the catalog, as well as writing customer reviews that will appear under the product.

The front end browsing will be available both for categories and subcategories for more convenient search.
The possibility of importing/exporting products in CSV will allow the user to make quick changes and to update the catalog easily.    
The view option can be determined in advance. You are able to use different views for different pages of your website.   
Captcha protection is added for the product reviews to avoid spam comments.   
 
If you want to customize the design of the catalog, you can buy the commercial version [here](https://web-dorado.com/products/wordpress-catalog.html). Color, font size and design of each element are customizable in the commercial version.

* Customize the product cell layout on the main page of the catalog and the product page separately.     
* Enable/disable ratings and customer reviews for the products.     
* Choose the background colors of practically all the fields of the item cell.   
* Customize the color of any text.
